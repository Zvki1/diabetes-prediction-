# Diabetes Prediction with KNN Algorithm

This repository contains a project focused on diabetes prediction using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of diabetes in an individual based on specific medical features.

## Contents

- **notebooks/**: This directory includes google collab notebook used for data exploration, KNN model training, and model performance evaluation.

- **data/**: processed datasets are located in this directory.

- **src/**: This directory contains project source code, including the code for KNN model training.

## How It Works

1. **Data Exploration**: Medical data is explored to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are prepared for modeling.

3. **KNN Model Training**: A KNN model is trained using the training data to predict the probability of diabetes based on medical features.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and the ROC curve.
